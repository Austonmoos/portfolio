    <h2>About Me!</h2>
    <p>Hi! Auston Moos here again, let me tell you a little about me. I just recently graduated High School at Scappoose(High School) and I was kind of rushed into adulthood all of a sudden. My only job experince has been working at Fred Meyer here in Scappoose Oregon, I work as a grocery parcel and tend to many many things there. This might sound weird, but my dad signed me up for the class. I actually quite like it so far, I kind of want to go down this path and become a programmer,designer or whatever this program sparks within me.</p>
